    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit more than a year ago (January 2021), the company GameStop along with a few other declining brands were at the center of a social media and stock market phenomenon. Multiple investment firms positioned themselves short these declining companies's stocks, meaning they expected them to fail, and rightfully so based on a long collection of data pointing towards this exact conclusion. Many independent retail investors took issue with these short positions, either because of long held sentiment for the brands or because of separate data they'd collected pointing towards a mistake in the short positions of the investment firms. Eventually these conflicting views came to a head, and the climax was primarily discussed on social media (as many things are today) and enacted on the mobile investment app Robinhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company Robinhood was founded in 2013, with the first available mobile app being released in 2015 on the iOS store. On the app users can view and trade stocks much like one can do on any other trading platform such as Fidelity or TD Ameritrade, but unlike other platforms users don't have to pay a commission fee to make their trades. As the name implies, the main ethos of Robinhood was to \"democratize finance.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Returning to the GameStop event of 2021, these two conflicting views on the direction of the company resulted in hoards of retail investors buying GME (the stock ticker for GameStop), particularly through the Robinhood app, pushing the price from just under 50 dollars per share on January 20th up to a peak of over 350 dollars per share on January 27th. Investment firms that held a short position were forced to abandon it, losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. Shortly after the peak the price of GME fell back to about 75 dollars per share by February 5th, causing those same retail investors to lose their money, too. Today it hovers around 120 dollars per share (April 29th, 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional news outlets were quick to point towards the mistake Robinhood's founders had made by \"democratizing finance.\" Rather than any particular party winning, it ended up producing an unpredictable and destructive event that lost many people a lot of money. The platonic ideal of democratization is attractive to many (as is easily seen by the funding Robinhood has received), but with the extreme volatility of the GameStop event, it is natural to ask: did the release of the mobile app for the trading platform Robinhood in 2015 result in a greater effect of social media sentiment on stock price volatility?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Literature Review\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often this question, or ones similar to it, have been answered using data specifically from the GameStop event in 2021. This makes sense since it, as is clear from the Introduction, inspired many to question the positive effects of democratizing finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Rise of Reddit: How Social Media Affects Retail Investors and Short-sellersâ€™ Roles in Price Discovery* by Hu, Jones, Zhang, and Zhang (2021) attempts to answer the question of how much of an effect social media had in the fluctuations of GME price. Using activity of the online community r/WallStreetBets (a subsection of the website Reddit) as a proxy for social media sentiment for GME, they find the expected relationship between sentiment and price movement holds, i.e. positive sentiment is associated with positive movement in price. In their analysis they focus on a list of 50 stocks that Robinhood had restricted access to amongst the GameStop event's volatility, which they use as a proxy for what stocks retail investors are interested in. Another one of their findings shows that higher activity on r/WallStreetBets is associated with greater retail investing activity, using the list of 50 stocks to measure said activity. They include an analysis surrounding \"Reddit influencers,\" popular accounts that may draw more significant attention to their stock trading decisions, and have a subsequent effect on retail investing activity. Their general findings point towards social media activity (in particular activity of the community r/WallStreetBets) having large potential for affecting both stock price movement and volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Zero-Commission Individual Investors, High Frequency Traders, and Stock Market Quality* by Eaton, Green, Roseman, and Wu (2021) are interested in answering the question of how informed retail investors are, and subsequently how much they contribute to greater market quality. Using measures of quoted spreads, effective spreads, realized spreads, and price impact to measure market quality and liquidity, they find that Robinhood outages (i.e. when the app goes down and users are unable to make trades) contribute to higher market quality. This indicates that retail investors using the app Robinhood are generally uninformed and contribute negatively to market quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Description and Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer my question I was interested in gathering data on Robinhood's popularity, stock market sentiment, and stock market prices. As a proxy for Robinhood's popularity, I collected data from Twitter, and count the number of times someone includes \"Robinhood\" in their tweet for each day in the range of interest (due to the size of the files created by scraping Twitter, I limit the range to January 1st, 2020 to April 1st, 2022). To collect this data I make use of the package \"snscrape,\" which uses Twitter's API and returns the tweets in the chosen timeframe that Twitter's search function would return:"

    "### First Dataset: Results and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The model run on the first dataset produced results counter to my original hypothesis, showing relatively little effect of Robinhood popularity on the price of SPY after controlling for stock market sentiment with the proxy variable of VIX value. There are a few reasons this could be the case, and they mainly stem from the possibility of imperfect proxy variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Twitter mentions seem like a reasonable proxy for popularity as it has lately been referred to as the modern \"town square,\" it doesn't take into account positive or negative publicity, and contrary to the old notion of any publicity being good publicity, it's unlikely that negative publicity has no negative effect on Robinhood's userbase. If instead of simply counting the number of Twitter mentions per day I was able to somehow measure sentiment on the website relating to Robinhood, it's possible this would be a better proxy for popularity. More to the point, though, I initially wanted to gather data on either the number of mobile app downloads or the number of users for the platform, but this data proved to be either too difficult or too expensive to access. I believe, though, that this would be the ideal proxy for Robinhood's popularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was also quite limited in my ability to gather data over a longer timeframe for this particular dataset. I would have preferred to collect data from before the release of Robinhood's mobile app until the present, but storage space and time would not allow this.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as measuring stock market sentiment, VIX value, as well as most other measures, can be assumed to have some flaw, since it is an extremely difficult quality to measure. For our purposes, though, VIX fit the requirements. Originally I was interested in gathering data on stock market volatility as a backup for data on sentiment, and since VIX measures *expected* volatility, it appeared to do both. There exist many other measures of stock market sentiment, but like the Robinhood user count and number of downloads, this typically required some form of payment, which I tried to avoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Second Dataset: Results and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests run on the second dataset produced mostly expected outcomes. It would make the most sense that the most significant difference amongst the four indicators was with the release of the iOS app, since that is truly when Robinhood became more mainstream, with each subsequent event having less effect on the increase in users than the simple passing of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A potential issue with these tests is that we have more data on the time before any of these events than we do after, and so by the final event (the release of Robinhood Gold) we are using much less information to estimate the difference between VIX coefficients than after the first event (the release of the app on iOS). This aspect may explain why the p-value simply grows by a small amount with each subsequent test. However, even if we had more data, say, until 2050, this same issue could still arise due to the events simply occurring after one another over time. We also do not include any covariates in the regressions, which could lead to biased estimates of the coefficients on the indicators or VIX. However, this may not have been an issue due to testing the *difference* between the coefficients instead of any tests relying on the magnitude of the coefficents.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "These results provide mixed conclusions. On the one hand, using Twitter data to measure the Robinhood's popularity seems to show that it has little to no significant effect on stock market prices, after controlling for sentiment. However, it appears that as Robinhood grew in popularity with each new feature released, we see a difference in the effect that sentiment actually has on stock market prices. One would expect then that a growth in popularity would have a significant effect on stock market prices, but our first analysis says otherwise. The ability to pull significantly more data from Twitter, particularly spanning the timeframe we focused on for the second dataset, as well as inclusion of a broader range of covariates or possible confounding variables would most likely prove to be of great interest in deducing the cause of this discrepancy."
